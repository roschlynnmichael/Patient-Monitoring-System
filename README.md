# Iot Based Patient Monitoring System üè•

We are Roschlynn and Francina, the developers of this repository. We have designed an IoT Based Remote Monitoring Solution that records patient vitals like heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation of the blood of a patient and records this data into the database.

We are Group 11 from Don Bosco Institute of Technology, Kurla(W), Mumbai-400070 and we thus present our final year project to you that has taken a full year to design, process, prototype and develop.

We faced a lot of challenges along the way that to a lot of learning and with a lot of errors due to poor documentation and library issues for Arduino and NodeMCU. But, we have been able to come through and design this entire project.
