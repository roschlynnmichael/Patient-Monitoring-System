# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Install Visual Studio Code from here https://code.visualstudio.com/

Install NodeJS from here https://nodejs.org/en/

# Create empty directory

Before you begin. It is necessary to create an empty directory. On windows just create a new folder of your choice where you want to store it either desktop or any drive of your choice. Then right click in the empty directory and click open with Visual Studio Code. 

Then click on new terminal to open a terminal in the current working directory. Once that is done run the command that is shown below.

# Before you do `npm start` 

Create a empty directory and run the command `npm create-react-app patient-monitor`. This will install all the necessary dependencies into the project folder directory.

# Install Firebase using npm 

Run the command `npm install firebase` to install the latest version of firebase

# Copy the react app files from the GitHub repository

Clear all the other folders except node_modules. 

Then Copy all the files from this repo into that folder you created and then you can proceed ahead.

# Change firebase.js authentication details

First make an app onto your firebase console to get a code snippet containing all the necessary configuration files.

Copy the snippet values as shown in my firebase.js file

Then go to your authentication section and enable login using email

Run `npm start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Please install firebase before you start with this.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
